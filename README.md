# SER515-Team21-SparkysLeague

## Summary
==========
This is the project repository for SER515 Foundations of Software Engineering. For this subject we were  
asked to create a website to help manage and conduct a soccer tournament.

## Technology Stack
===================
This project was created with the MERN stack ( MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js ).
- MongoDB is a document-oriented database which stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema.
- ExpressJS is a prebuilt NodeJS framework that can help you in creating server-side web applications faster and smarter.
- React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.
- Node.js is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as  
  traditional web sites and back-end API services.
