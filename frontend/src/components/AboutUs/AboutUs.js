<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1977 as the Johnson County Soccer League to promote youth soccer in Johnson County, Kansas. &nbsp; 600 players were initially split geographically according to school districts with the Shawnee Mission School District split, due to its size.</p>
<p>The Kansas Premier Soccer League (KPSL) was established a few years later for players who were ready to expand to competitive soccer and in 1995, KPSL joined Johnson County Soccer as a member club and both the leagues became&nbsp;<em>Sparky Soccer Association</em>.</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;<em>Sparky Soccer Association</em>&nbsp;is a nonprofit and educational youth soccer association and has grown through the years to be the largest and most competitive youth soccer league in the United States.</p>
